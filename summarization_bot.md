# 💻 LangChain SQL Database ChatBot

A powerful, interactive chatbot built with **LangChain**, **Groq's LLM**, and **Streamlit**. Query your own database—either the bundled SQLite demo (`student.db`) or any MySQL instance—using plain English. Powered by generative AI, the assistant converts your question into SQL, runs it, and replies conversationally, complete with real-time agent reasoning.

**App Link**: _[SQL Database Chatbot](https://sql-database-chatbot-ninyrmtqdedgeybtrlg6v9.streamlit.app)_

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **Connects to Your Database:**
    - Use the included `student.db` SQLite or connect instantly to any MySQL database with your credentials.
- 🧠 **Natural Language Queries:**
    - Ask any question in plain English—get meaningful, data-backed answers.
- 🤖 **LLM-Powered Agent:**
    - Integrates Groq’s Gemma2-9b LLM with LangChain agents for zero-shot SQL generation.
- 🧩 **Real-Time Thoughts \& Explanations:**
    - See exactly how the AI thinks via `StreamlitCallbackHandler`.
- 🔐 **No Hardcoded Secrets:**
    - Secure Groq API and database credentials via sidebar input or Streamlit secrets.
- 🗂️ **Session-Based Chat Memory:**
    - Keeps your chat history for the session; clear anytime.


## 📦 Requirements

Before running or deploying, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.10.x** (recommended: 3.10.17 for Streamlit compatibility)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Groq API Key** ([Sign up here](https://console.groq.com))
- (Optional for MySQL): MySQL server credentials (host, user, password, database name)


## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **User launches the app** via Streamlit (locally or in the cloud).
2. **Choose your database:**
    - Use the built-in `student.db` sample, or
    - Connect to your own MySQL database by entering details in the sidebar.
3. **Enter your Groq API key** in the sidebar.
4. **Ask questions** in the chat—e.g., "List all students in the Computer Science major".
5. **Behind the scenes:**
    - The LLM interprets your question, generates valid SQL, and safely queries your chosen database.
    - Results are replied back conversationally—with agent "thoughts" visible in real time for full transparency.

Certainly! Below is a **README.md** tailored for your **LangChain-based Summarization Bot** Streamlit app, inspired by the style and structure of the example you provided:

# 🧵 LangChain Summarization Bot

An intuitive, multi-source summarization app built with **LangChain**, **Groq's Gemma2-9b LLM**, and **Streamlit**. Summarize content from YouTube videos, webpages, PDFs, or CSV files — all with a simple link or file upload. Powered by generative AI, the assistant extracts, processes, and summarizes the content conversationally.

**App Link**: _[Your Streamlit App Link Here]_

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 **YouTube Summarization:**
Extracts subtitles/captions using `pytubefix` for reliable video transcript processing.
- 🌐 **Webpage Summarization:**
Summarizes any URL with extracted textual content.
- 📄 **PDF and CSV File Support:**
Upload files directly and get concise summaries without system dependencies like Poppler.
- 🤖 **LLM-Powered Summarization:**
Integrates Groq’s Gemma2-9b-It model via LangChain for accurate, fluent summaries.
- 💡 **Advanced Chain Types:**
Uses LangChain’s built-in `map_reduce` summarization chain for automatic chunking and summarization prompting.
- 🔐 **Secure API and Secrets Handling:**
Manage Groq API keys and LangSmith tracking tokens securely via Streamlit secrets or sidebar input.
- 📈 **Optional LangSmith Tracking:**
Track your app’s LangChain runs, prompts, and outputs with LangSmith integration.


## 📦 Requirements

Before running or deploying, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.10.x** (recommended: 3.10.17 for Streamlit compatibility)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Groq API Key** ([Sign up here](https://console.groq.com))
- (Optional for local dev) `.env` file or Streamlit secrets for keys
- Poppler is **not required** (using `PyPDFLoader` makes PDF loading simpler in cloud environments)


## 🏗️ How It Works

1. **User launches the app** locally or on Streamlit Cloud.
2. **Upload a PDF or CSV file**, or paste a YouTube/video/webpage URL.
3. **Provide your Groq API Key** in the sidebar.
4. The app extracts the text (including YouTube subtitles using `pytubefix`).
5. **LangChain’s `map_reduce` summarization chain** splits, summarizes chunks, and composes a final summary using Groq’s LLM.
6. The summarized output is shown conversationally on the web interface.

## 📝 Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure your secrets:**

- Locally, add a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with:

```toml
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="Summarization Bot"
```

- On Streamlit Cloud, add the same keys in the “Secrets” section.

4. **Run the app:**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. **On the web app:**

- Upload files or paste URLs/YouTube video URLs.
- Enter your API key if not set in secrets.
- Click “Summarize the content” and receive your summary.


## ⚙️ Configuration

- **requirements.txt**

```
streamlit
langchain
langchain-community
langchain_groq
pytubefix
pypdf
unstructured
validators
python-dotenv
```

- **Streamlit Secrets:**

```toml
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="Summarization Bot"
```

- **Python version:** 3.10.17 recommended for best compatibility.


## 🧩 LangSmith Tracing (Optional)

- Enables detailed logging and trace visualization on [LangSmith](https://console.langchain.com).
- Simply set the above environment variables (`LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`, `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`) to activate tracing.
- Summarizes prompt and output data for audit and debugging purposes.


## 🖥️ Sample User Flow

1. **Open app** and either upload a PDF or CSV or paste a URL/YouTube video link.
2. **Enter Groq API key** in the sidebar or Streamlit secrets.
3. **Click 'Summarize the content'** to trigger summarization.
4. **View the concise summary** presented instantly in the UI.

## ❓ FAQ

**Why doesn’t the YouTube URL always work?**

- The app uses `pytubefix` to reliably extract captions.
- Some videos may have no subtitles available, so they cannot be summarized.

**Is my API key secure?**

- Yes! Keys are never hardcoded and can be safely managed with Streamlit secrets.

**Why does PDF summarization work without Poppler?**

- This app uses `PyPDFLoader` which does not require external tools like Poppler, making it cloud-friendly.

**Can I customize the summarization prompts?**

- The app uses LangChain’s built-in `map_reduce` chain with default prompts for simplicity and robustness.
